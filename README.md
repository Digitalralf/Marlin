# Marlin Firmware for Anet A8 Plus with a BTT SKR 1.4 Board

This is a fork of marlin with a configuration for an Anet A8 plus with a BigTreeTech SKR v1.4 board in it instead of the original Anet board. I found that the original steppers where way to loud so I changed the board. 

This fork is for my own convenience, it is based on the original example config for the A8 plus, The config given from BTT and some of my own modification I made. Be aware that I did made some hardware modification related tot the screen cable and modified the endstops plugs to have the logic be inverted. In the future i might specify what those changes exactly are. I am not responsible for the failure of your printer if you decide to use anything of what I make.
